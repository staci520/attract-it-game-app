                                    We attract into our lives what we focus on. Our thoughts, feelings, actions and
                                    intentions are magnetic. That's the Law of Attraction! It's fun to attract new things
                                    into your life when you are clear on a goal, open to change, and playful.
                                    On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you of achieving your goal?
                                    For 30 seconds imagine a scene in your mind in which you have already achieved your
                                    goal. What will you hear, see and feel when it's reached?
